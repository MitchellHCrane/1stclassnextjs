      <p className="mb-4">
        Section 502-509 of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and its

        nonaffiliated third parties; and provide a method for consumers to
        prevent companies from disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated
        third parties by opting-out of that disclosure. Furthermore, the Fair
        Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Right to Financial Privacy Act
        (RFPA) contain provisions to ensure protection of the financial
        information of consumers.

        privacy regulations are more stringent than the requirements set forth
        in this Policy, the more stringent requirement will be followed.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        First Class Home Mortgage will send a copy of the privacy notice to all
        new customers in the timeframes specified in the Privacy Rule. First
        Class Home Mortgage will also provide a privacy notice annually during

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">6. Revised Notices</h2>
      <p>
        The Privacy Rule is designed to enable consumers to make opt-out
        decisions based on an accurate description of a financial
        institution&apos;s privacy policies and practices. Before disclosing NPI
        about a consumer to a nonaffiliated third party other than as described
        in First Class Home Mortgage&apos;s most recent privacy notice, First
        Class Home Mortgage must provide the consumer a revised initial notice,
        a new opt-out notice, and reasonable opportunity to opt out. A revised
        notice is not required in the instance where First Class Home Mortgage
        makes a change to disclose NPI to a new nonaffiliated third party that
        was adequately described in its prior notice.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">7. Delivery Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        First Class Home Mortgage provides the required privacy and opt-out
        notices simultaneously. First Class Home Mortgage provides privacy
        notices and opt-out notices so that each consumer can reasonably be
        expected to receive actual notice in writing. The notice can be
        hand-delivered, mailed, or, if the consumer consents, delivered
        electronically.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">
        8. Prohibition on Disclosure of Account Notices
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Privacy Rule prohibits financial institutions from sharing account
        numbers or similar access numbers or codes for marketing purposes. This
        prohibition applies even when a consumer or customer has not opted-out
        of the disclosure of NPI concerning his or her account. Under no
        circumstances will First Class Home Mortgage disclose, other than to
        consumer reporting agencies, access codes or account numbers for use in
        marketing.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">
        9. Limitations on Redisclosure or Reuse of NPI
      </h2>

        When a financial institution receives NPI from a nonaffiliated financial
        institution, its disclosure and use of the information is limited as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          For NPI received under any of the privacy and opt-out notice
          exceptions outlined above, the financial institution is limited to:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            Disclosing the information to the affiliates of the financial
            institution from which it received the information;
          </li>
          <li>
            Disclosing the information to its own affiliates, who may, in turn,
            disclose and use the information only to the extent that the
            financial institution can do so;
          </li>
          <li>
            Disclosing and using the information pursuant to any of the privacy
            and opt-out notice exceptions outlined above (for example, an

          limited to:

          <li>
            Disclosing the information to any other person, if the disclosure

        10. Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), among other things, allows
        financial institutions to share information with others about its own
        transactions or experiences with a consumer. However, when a financial
        institution shares information about third-parties&apos; transactions
        with a consumer, such as sharing a list of its customers and information
        such as their credit scores with another financial institution to
        jointly market or sponsor other financial products or services, it could
        cause the financial institution to be considered a consumer reporting
        agency that is subject to strict guidelines under FCRA. Furthermore,
        civil or criminal penalties could apply if a financial institution fails
        to comply with any requirements of the FCRA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial institutions can avoid additional requirements and penalties
        under FCRA by not providing others with information from credit reports
        or third-party transactions. Additionally, FCRA contains an exception
        that allows financial institutions to share information contained in
        consumer reports and other information, such as information on an
        application for credit, as long as that information is shared with an
        affiliate and before the information can be used for marketing and
        solicitation, the financial institution:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          clearly and conspicuously discloses to the consumer that the
          information may be shared with an affiliate; and
        </li>
        <li>
          gives the consumer the opportunity, before the information is shared,

        The GLBA notice is sufficient to meet FCRA notice requirements for
        sharing information with affiliates. Furthermore, the FCRA notice and
        opt-out requirements do not apply to a financial institution if it uses
        eligibility information that it receives from an affiliate to make a
        solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer with whom the
        financial institution has a preexisting business relationship.

        11. The Right to Financial Privacy Act
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) protects a customer&apos;s
        right to privacy with respect to information being disclosed to the
        federal government regarding the financial records maintained about the
        customer by financial institutions. The RFPA is intended to balance the
        federal government&apos;s need for information when conducting a
        criminal investigation with the customer&apos;s right to privacy. It
        establishes specific procedures that federal government authorities must
        follow in order to obtain information from a financial institution about
        a customer&apos;s financial records. Generally, these requirements
        include obtaining subpoenas, notifying the customer of the request, and
        providing the customer with an opportunity to object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the RFPA, the government must reasonably describe the records it
        wants and may use one of five methods to obtain those records:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Customer Authorization</li>
        <p>
          Under this method the customer must give a signed and dated
          authorization to both the government and the institution. Further, the
          authorization muststate the customer&apos;s rights under the RFPA. In
          this document, the customer must:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Authorize the disclosures for no more than 3 months.</li>
          <li>
            State that the authorization can be revoked at any time before
            records are disclosed.
          </li>
          <li>Identify the records to be disclosed</li>
          <li>
            Specify the purpose for which, and the government authority to
            which, records may be disclosed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Administrative Subpoena or Summons</li>
        <p>
          A government authority may obtain financial records using an
          administrative subpoena or summons if there is reason to believe the
          records are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. A copy
          of the subpoena or summons must have been served to the customer, or
          mailed to the customer&apos;slast known address, on or before the date
          on which it wasserved to the financial institution and it should
          include a notice regarding the nature of the law enforcement inquiry
          and notify the customer of his or her right, and procedures, to
          contest the inquiry.
        </p>
        <li>Search Warrants</li>
        <p>
          Search warrants must be obtained according to the federal rules of
          criminal procedure. The customer must receive a copy of the search
          warrant no later than ninety days after it is issued and receive a
          notice of his or her rights under the RFPA.
        </p>
        <li>Judicial Subpoena</li>
        <p>
          A government authority can obtain financial records under a judicial
          subpoena only if there is a reason to believe the records are relevant
          to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. When a judicial subpoena is
          issued, the subpoena must have been served to the customer, or mailed
          to the customer&apos;s last known address, and it must state the
          nature of the law enforcement inquiry and notify the customer of his
          or her right, and procedures, to contest the inquiry.
        </p>
        <li>Formal written request</li>
        <p>
          A government agency may request financial records using a formal
          written request only if all of the following conditions are met:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The government agency doesn&apos;t appear to have legal authority to
            issue a summons or subpoena;
          </li>
          <li>
            The request is authorized by regulation issued by the head of the
            agency; or
          </li>
          <li>
            There is reason to believe the records are relevant to a legitimate
            law enforcement inquiry.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When a formal written request is used, it must have been served to the
          customer, or mailed to the customer&apos;s last known address, and it
          must state the nature of the law enforcement inquiry and notify the
          customer of his or her right, and procedures, to contest the inquiry.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The RFPA also contains exceptions for depository institutions under 12
        US Code Section 3413, allowing these institutions to, among other
        things, disclose:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          financial records that are not identified with or identified as coming
          from a particular customer;
        </li>
        <li>customer financial records to its supervisory agencies;</li>
        <li>
          financial records or information required by federal statute; and
        </li>
        <li>
          financial information in accordance with procedures authorized by the
          IRS.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
